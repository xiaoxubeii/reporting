 * The chrome for every signed-out, full-page screen: sign-in, sign-up, password reset,
 * MFA, and the OAuth consent screen.
 *
 * It exists because that chrome was previously copy-pasted — byte for byte — into six auth
 * pages, while the OAuth pages had none of it at all and consequently looked like a
 * different product bolted on at the moment a user is being asked to hand an agent the
 * keys to their fund. That is the worst possible place to look unfamiliar.
 *
 * The wordmark links home. Someone who lands here from the demo and decides not to sign in
 * has no other way back to the marketing site.
