 * The fund overview — the landing page for the whole accounting section.
 *
 * Performance per vehicle, derived from the ledger. The subpages (capital accounts,
 * statements, journal, …) are reached from the sidebar subnav, so this page does NOT repeat
 * them as a grid of link cards — that was duplicative — and the per-vehicle rows don't link
 * either. See lib/accounting/fund-economics.ts for why "net to LP" is exact here rather than
 * estimated.
 *
 * FundOverview owns its own empty state: with no vehicle carrying any capital, it explains how
 * to onboard one rather than showing a blank table. (Per-vehicle setup lives on the Admin
 * page, /funds/status.)
