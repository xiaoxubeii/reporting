/**
 * The fund detail page — the LEAD page for a single vehicle.
 *
 * `/funds` is the whole-fund overview (every vehicle in one table); this is where a vehicle row
 * on it now leads. It carries the vehicle's key metrics (same box style as the overview and the
 * LP snapshot), the schedule-of-investments breakdown, and the growth / NAV-composition charts.
 * The operational admin — onboarding, the close, the health check, allocation settings — lives on
 * the fund's `status` subpage, reached from the sidebar (Funds → Admin).
 *
 * `[id]` is the vehicle's stable `fund_vehicles.id` (a UUID), the same way companies and LPs are
 * addressed — routing on the id survives a rename and sidesteps names with slashes. We resolve it
 * to the name here (via resolveVehicleParam) and hand the client both, because the accounting data
 * still keys on the portfolio_group string while the switcher/sidebar route on the id. A legacy
 * vehicle with no registry row is addressed by its name directly, so an un-migrated fund still
 * works. Every fund page owns its own header (fund switcher + Analyst) and wraps its body in
 * <AccountingBody>; there is no shared vehicle-selector bar — the URL pins the vehicle.
