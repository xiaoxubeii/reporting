// Answering a partner question about a deal, from the deal's own evidence.
//
// This was inline in app/api/diligence/[id]/qa-chat/route.ts. It moved here so the
// agent/MCP tool can ask the same question and get the SAME answer — same prompt, same
// citation validation, same provider and cost accounting. A second copy of this prompt
// would drift from the first within a release, and the two surfaces would start
// disagreeing about the same data room.
//
// What this does NOT do is persist anything. The chat route owns the conversation
// (`diligence_qa_chats`) and the evidence-base promotion into the draft's `qa_answers`;
// an agent asking a read-only question must not write to either, or every tool call
// would silently graffiti the partner's chat history and the memo's evidence base.

AFFINITY CRM ACCESS
You can query the fund's Affinity CRM with the affinity_* tools to answer questions about the
RELATIONSHIP history — past meetings, call notes, who introduced us, what was discussed and when.
${linkedOrgId
    ? `This deal is already linked to Affinity organization_id ${linkedOrgId}. Use that id directly; you do not need to search for it.`
    : `This deal is not linked to an Affinity company yet, so use affinity_search_companies first to find it by name.`}

When to reach for Affinity:
- The question is about history, relationships, or what was said in a meeting — the data room holds
  documents, but the CRM holds the conversation record.
- The data-room evidence below does not answer the question and the CRM plausibly might.

Do NOT use Affinity for questions the data room already answers — it costs a round-trip and the
documents are the primary evidence. Content you take from Affinity should be attributed in your
answer as coming from an Affinity note (with its date), not cited as a data-room document.`
    : ''

  const systemPrompt = `You answer partner questions about an active diligence deal using the evidence below${affinityAvailable ? ', plus the fund\'s Affinity CRM when the question is about relationship history' : ''}. If the evidence does not contain the answer, say so plainly and suggest where the partner could look (a missing document, a research gap, a question to ask the founders).

Rules:
- Be concise and direct. No throat-clearing.
- Never fabricate numbers, names, or sources.
- When you cite a document, reference it by its file name as listed in DATA-ROOM EVIDENCE.
- If multiple sources agree, say so. If they contradict, surface the contradiction.
- Stage-aware: ${ctx.stage ? `this is a ${ctx.stage} company, calibrate expectations accordingly` : 'no stage on record, ask the partner if it matters'}.${affinityBlock}

Output format: return JSON ONLY of the form:
{
  "answer": "<your answer in plain text, 1–5 short paragraphs>",
  "citations": [{ "document_id": "<doc_id from the evidence>", "summary": "<one-line note about what you took from this doc>" }]
}

Cite up to 5 documents. Only cite document_ids that actually appear in DATA-ROOM EVIDENCE.
