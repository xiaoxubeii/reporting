This memo is an INVESTMENT ARGUMENT, not a report. Before planning sections,
decide the spine of the memo: What is the bet? What are the two or three
things that have to be true for this to be a great investment? What is the
single biggest risk? Plan the memo so it builds that argument — every
section should advance it, not just catalogue facts.

Planning rules:
  • Section set & order: if the PER-DEAL MEMO CONFIG block specifies an explicit section list, use EXACTLY that set and order (those are partner-defined and override the schema) — still excluding "scoring_summary" and "appendix" if present. Otherwise, include every section from memo_output.yaml EXCEPT "scoring_summary" and "appendix" (those come from later stages).
  • Plan FEWER, sharper paragraphs over exhaustive coverage. A section that makes one clear point in two paragraphs beats one that makes five diffuse ones. Only plan a paragraph if it earns its place in the argument.
  • The "recommendation" section gets exactly ONE paragraph with topic "[partner-only placeholder]".
  • The "team" section SHOULD plan MULTIPLE paragraphs: (a) factual_summary — per-founder background; (b) prior_work — what each founder built/shipped/led, with sourced specifics; (c) public_output — papers, talks, OSS, public writing; (d) references_to_qa — partner Q&A about the team. Plus placeholder paragraphs for character_assessment and founder_market_fit_judgment.
  • Each "topic" is one concise line describing the POINT the paragraph makes (e.g. "why the wedge into mid-market is defensible"), not the facts it lists. The section-fill step has the full source data and will pick exact citations.
  • Surface genuine concerns as partner_attention items — but calibrate to stage (see calibration above): do not raise the absence of late-stage data as something the partner must address.`

WRITING STANDARDS — this is what the partner feedback is about. Follow closely:
  • Be INVESTIGATIVE, not a reporter. Lead with what the evidence MEANS for the
    investment decision — the judgment, the implication, the "so what" — then
    support it. Do not catalogue facts and leave the reader to interpret them.
  • Tell a STORY. The memo should read as a connected argument: each paragraph
    follows from the last and advances the case. Use transitions. Don't write
    a list of disconnected observations.
  • Write the way an experienced partner writes to their own partnership —
    direct, opinionated, plain-spoken, willing to take a view. Not hedged
    corporate prose, not marketing language.
  • Be CONCISE. Vary length to serve the point — a sharp two-sentence
    observation can outweigh a dense paragraph. Cut anything that doesn't
    advance the argument. Density is a flaw, not a virtue.
  • Sourcing supports the point; it is not the point. Cite to back a claim,
    but never let citation crowd out insight.
  • Match the stage (see calibration above). Frame early-stage uncertainty as
    normal; do not write as though missing late-stage data is a red flag.

Hard rules:
  • Write a paragraph for every planned paragraph in the sections to write — match the planned id, section_id, order.
  • If the plan includes the "recommendation" section: emit it as origin="partner_only_placeholder", prose="[Partner to complete]", sources=[], confidence="n/a", contains_*=false. Do NOT draft a recommendation.
  • Team placeholder paragraphs (character_assessment, founder_market_fit_judgment) get origin="partner_only_placeholder", prose="[Partner to complete]". Do NOT interpret character or fit. Do NOT score the team.
  • Every agent_drafted paragraph MUST have at least one source.
  • Every paragraph that mentions a forward-looking number sets contains_projection=true.
  • Every paragraph relying on an unverified claim sets contains_unverified_claim=true.
  • Cite source_ids that actually appear in the input data above. Never invent ids.`

const REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS = `Output JSON ONLY. Return ONLY paragraphs that genuinely need improvement.

{
  "edits": [
    {
      "paragraph_id": string,            // must match a paragraph id from the first-draft memo above

      "reason": string                   // one line: what was wrong and what you fixed
    }
  ]
}

You are the senior editor. Read the whole draft, then fix what's weak —
prioritise the partner's feedback that the memo reads as a dense report
rather than an investigative argument:

  1. Story & flow — does the memo build a connected argument? Fix paragraphs
     that read as disconnected observations; add the through-line so each
     point follows from the last.
  2. Insight over reporting — rewrite paragraphs that catalogue facts without
     saying what they MEAN for the decision. Lead with the judgment.
  3. Density — tighten flabby, overlong, or padded paragraphs. Cut anything
     that doesn't advance the argument. Shorter and sharper is better.
  4. Voice — replace hedged, corporate, or marketing-flavoured prose with
     direct, opinionated partner-style writing.
  5. Stage fit — rewrite anything that penalises the company for lacking
     data it can't be expected to have at this stage (see calibration above).
  6. Sourcing accuracy — fix prose that asserts more than the source supports,
     or reads as verified when the claim is company-stated/unverified.

Rules:
  • Do NOT return paragraphs that are already good. An empty edits array is valid.
  • Do NOT rewrite partner_only_placeholder paragraphs (prose "[Partner to complete]"). Leave them alone.
  • Do NOT draft a recommendation or score the team.
  • Do NOT pad paragraphs to a length target — tightening is an improvement.
  • revised_prose replaces the paragraph's prose verbatim — return the full improved paragraph, not a diff.`
