/**
 * Worker entry point for the `affinity_sync` kind — the ongoing half of the
 * Affinity integration. Pulls anything new since the last run into the data room
 * and queues it for ingest.
 *
 * Runs as the key of the user who linked the deal. If that user has disconnected
 * Affinity (or their key was revoked), the sync stops cleanly and says so rather
 * than failing loudly every hour: a disconnected colleague is an expected state,
 * not an incident. The deal room surfaces it as "sync paused".
 *
 * Import itself is idempotent (deduped on Affinity's note/file ids with partial
 * unique indexes), so a re-run after a partial failure is safe.
