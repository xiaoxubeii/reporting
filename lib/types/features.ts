/**
 * Returns true if the feature is switched on for this user at the FUND level.
 *
 * This is the ceiling, not the answer: what a given member may actually read or write is
 * `effectiveAccess` in lib/access/effective.ts, which consults this and then their per-user grant.
 * Prefer that everywhere; this is exported for the nav and for the grant resolver itself.
 *
 * - "everyone": on; members reach it subject to their grant
 * - "admin": on; admins only, whatever a member's grant says
 * - "off": DENIED to everyone, admins included. The data is retained; nothing serves it. Turning
 *   `interactions` off also stops the email pipeline extracting them (lib/pipeline/processEmail.ts)
 *   — the only place `off` does anything beyond denying.
 * - "hidden": LEGACY, identical to "off". Still accepted so stored rows keep working; no longer
 *   offered in Settings.
 *
 * `off` and `hidden` deny rather than merely un-nav. `hidden` used to mean "removed from
 * navigation (feature still works if accessed directly)" — which is not access control: the nav
 * hid the panel while the API underneath happily served the data. Once that was fixed, `hidden`
 * and `off` became the same thing, so Settings stopped offering both.
 * See plans/plan-access-control.md.
